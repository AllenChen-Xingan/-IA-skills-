# Interestingness Analyzer

Identify small-world, high-value information and opportunities using the interestingness (有趣度) framework developed by Yang Zhiping, based on Murray Davis's theory.

## Core Concept

**Interestingness (有趣度)**: Small-world yet high-value information

**Formula**:
```
Interestingness = Value Weight × (1 - Visibility Weight) × Boundary-Crossing Degree
```

**Essence**: Find what looks worthless but is actually valuable - before everyone else discovers it.

## Quick Start

When a user asks to analyze interestingness, follow this workflow:

### 1. Clarify the Analysis Target

Ask the user what they want to analyze:
- A research topic or academic field
- A business/investment opportunity
- A career direction or skill
- A trend or emerging technology
- A specific company, person, or idea

### 2. Apply the Interestingness Framework

Use the three-step analysis:

**Step 1: Map the Network**
- Identify core nodes (mainstream/high visibility)
- Identify edge nodes (niche/low visibility)
- Identify structural holes (gaps between communities)

**Step 2: Evaluate Node Weights**
- **Value Weight** (0-10): Actual value/impact/potential
- **Visibility Weight** (0-1): How well-known it is (0=unknown, 1=everyone knows)
- **Boundary-Crossing** (1-3): How many cognitive/social boundaries it crosses

**Step 3: Calculate Interestingness Score**
```
Score = Value × (1 - Visibility) × Boundary-Crossing
```

### 3. Apply Davis's 12 Patterns

Check if the target exhibits any of these "interesting" patterns:

**Ontological (Existence)**:
1. **Organization**: Looks disorganized → actually organized (or reverse)
2. **Composition**: Looks homogeneous → actually heterogeneous (or reverse)

**Methodological (Classification)**:
3. **Abstraction**: Looks individual → actually collective (or reverse)
4. **Generalization**: Looks local → actually universal (or reverse)
5. **Stabilization**: Looks stable → actually unstable (or reverse)
6. **Function**: Appears to have function X → actually has function Y

**Causal (Causation)**:
7. **Co-relation**: Looks independent → actually correlated (or reverse)
8. **Co-existence**: Looks mutually exclusive → can coexist (or reverse)
9. **Co-variation**: Looks positively correlated → negatively correlated (or reverse)
10. **Opposition**: A causes B → A causes non-B (or reverse)
11. **Causation**: A causes B → B causes A (reverse causality)
12. **Contingency**: A always causes B → only under specific conditions

### 4. Assess the Goldilocks Zone

Determine if the interestingness level is:
- **Too Weak (Obvious)**: "Isn't that obvious?" → No attention
- **Just Right (Interesting)**: "That's interesting!" → Attracts attention, sparks thinking
- **Too Strong (Absurd)**: "That's ridiculous!" → Gets rejected

### 5. Identify Arbitrage Opportunities

Based on the analysis, suggest:
- **Information Arbitrage**: What non-consensus knowledge can be leveraged?
- **Timing**: When is the optimal window before it becomes mainstream?
- **Action**: What specific actions can exploit this opportunity?

## Instructions

When analyzing interestingness, you MUST:

1. **Start with Context**: Understand what the user wants to analyze and why

2. **Map the Network Landscape**:
   - Use web search or domain knowledge to identify mainstream vs niche positions
   - Identify who knows about this (visibility) vs who doesn't
   - Find structural holes and boundary positions

3. **Calculate Systematically**:
   - Assign concrete scores with justification
   - Show your calculation clearly
   - Explain what each score means

4. **Apply Pattern Recognition**:
   - Check against all 12 Davis patterns
   - Identify which patterns apply
   - Explain why this makes it "interesting"

5. **Provide Actionable Insights**:
   - Don't just calculate - interpret
   - Suggest specific arbitrage strategies
   - Warn about timing (interestingness decays over time)
   - Consider the dynamic: edge → core = decreasing interestingness

6. **Use the Reference Materials**:
   - For detailed theory, refer to [reference.md](reference.md)
   - For case studies, refer to [examples.md](examples.md)
   - For analysis templates, use files in [templates/](templates/)

## Key Principles

**Interesting > True**: In the attention economy, being interesting is the entry ticket. Truth comes after attention.

**Edge Position = High Interestingness**: Information at network edges (niche) with high value has maximum arbitrage potential.

**Interestingness Decays**: As information moves from edge to core, visibility increases, interestingness decreases. Act before it becomes mainstream.

**Boundary Crossing = Value**: The more cognitive/social boundaries crossed, the higher the potential value.

**Relative to Audience**: What's interesting depends on the audience's existing assumptions. Same information can be obvious, interesting, or absurd to different audiences.

## Output Format

Structure your analysis as:

```markdown
## Interestingness Analysis: [Target]

### 1. Network Position
- Current position: [edge/core/structural hole]
- Visibility assessment: [who knows, who doesn't]
- Boundary analysis: [what boundaries exist]

### 2. Interestingness Score
- Value Weight: X/10 - [justification]
- Visibility Weight: Y (0-1) - [justification]
- Boundary-Crossing: Z (1-3) - [justification]
- **Interestingness Score: [calculation]**

- Assumption being negated: [what common belief is challenged]

### 4. Goldilocks Assessment
- Level: [Obvious/Interesting/Absurd]
- For audience: [who would find this interesting]
- Reasoning: [why this level]

- **Recommended Actions**: [specific steps]
- **Risks**: [what could go wrong]

### 6. Dynamic Forecast

- Future potential: [will it stay interesting, become obvious, or create new patterns]
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Academic Research**: Find interesting research topics that are valuable but understudied
- **Investment Analysis**: Identify "looks poor, actually rich" companies before the market discovers them
- **Career Planning**: Find high-value, low-competition career directions
- **Trend Analysis**: Spot non-consensus trends in the AI era before they become mainstream
- **Product Ideas**: Generate interesting product concepts using pattern reversal
- **Content Creation**: Create interesting theories/content that challenges assumptions

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Don't just say "high value" - quantify and justify
2. **Show Your Work**: Make calculations transparent
3. **Consider Multiple Patterns**: One target may exhibit several Davis patterns
4. **Think Dynamically**: Always consider how interestingness changes over time
5. **Validate Assumptions**: What assumptions are being challenged? Are they widely held?
6. **Balance Interestingness**: Aim for the Goldilocks zone - not too obvious, not too absurd
7. **Connect to Action**: Always end with concrete arbitrage strategies

## Examples

- Early Tencent (high interestingness → low as it became mainstream)
- AI-only academic journal (applying Opposition pattern)
